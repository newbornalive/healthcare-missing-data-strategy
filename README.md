# Missing Data Strategy in Healthcare 
## Project Overview 
This project focuses on handling missing data in healthcare datasets using imputation and predictive modeling techniques. 
## Techniques Used 
- Bayesian Imputation 
- Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) 
## Setup Instructions 
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:newbornalive/healthcare-missing-data-strategy.git` 
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
## Next Steps 
- Data preprocessing and analysis of missing patterns 
- Implementing imputation methods (Bayesian, MICE, KNN) 
- Evaluating the impact of missing data handling on predictive models
